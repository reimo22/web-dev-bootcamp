        <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
        <p>
          Since I was young I had a penchant for puzzles and challenges which
          naturally led me to math and programming. I am a tinkerer, I rooted my
          first phone when I was 13 and experimented with custom ROMs and
          kernels, even bricking a phone in the process. (I used to run
          Resurrection Remix on my S5). I also regularly installed modded apks
          and used lucky patcher and game guardian on my games. I even had 99999
          gems on Pixel Gun 3d at one point. There's also a time where I bought
          capacitors and tried (and failed) to build a homemade taser. I am
          generally the guy you call to get the TV, printer or wifi working or
          even just to assemble desks and cabinets. Did I say I also like lego?
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout grade school and high school we had some really good
          exposure to computing. We were taught how to use Word, PowerPoint and
          Excel to create documents and presentations. I had my first exposure
          to programming using Scratch, I remember my final project was a game
          show where you are asked to perform arithmetic from randomly generated
          numbers. Then we moved on to making games in Greenfoot, then animation
          in flash. We also learned some web development, and a little photo
          editing. Then I graduated from senior high.
        </p>
        <p>
          That summer, I took an online course—CS50x where I learned to code in
          C, how to use google and stackoverflow and read documentation, as well
          as problem solving in general. Then I enrolled in computer science. In
          my first semester of college, we went over building static webpages
          using HTML5 and CSS3 and an introduction to programming in C#, which
          at this point is just a recap for me. Right now I'm studying webpage
          layout / design and javascript and taking CSS NC2. My current pastimes
          are reading webnovels or playing on codewars or hackerrank.
